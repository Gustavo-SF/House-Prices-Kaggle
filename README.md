# House Prices Kaggle

This project has been developed for the Machine Learning subject of the Data Science course in FCUL. The objective was to create a model that predicts house prices. The code was developed in a Jupyter Notebook, and it is available both in `.ipynb` and `.html` formats.

The data is a modified version of the [Kaggle's House Price competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neolen-house-price-prediction).
